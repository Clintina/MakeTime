## 🚧 Project Status

This is an early-stage prototype and not a finalized product.
MakeTime represents the vision for a fully realized time management tool — one that helps users prioritize what matters most through intuitive scheduling and thoughtful design.

Current features demonstrate core functionality and UI direction, but the app is still under active development.
Expect ongoing changes, refinements, and new features as the project evolves toward its end goal.
